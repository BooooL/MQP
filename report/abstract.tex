\section*{Abstract}
This project implemented a system for generating detailed maps and imagery of an area in real-time by gathering camera imagery, as well as localization and distance measurements from an IMU and a rangefinder. It relied on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA, as FPGAs offer unique advantages in latency and power consumption, and create a favorable platform for common image processing algorithms. All output data from the system has been fully processed, allowing the data to be viewed without further processing.

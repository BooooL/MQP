\section*{Abstract}
%This project implemented a system for generating detailed maps %and imagery of an area in real-time by gathering camera %imagery, as well as localization and distance measurements %from an IMU and a rangefinder. It relied on a Xilinx Zynq %FPGA, as FPGAs offer unique advantages in latency and power %consumption, and create a favorable platform for common image %processing algorithms. All output data from the system has %been fully processed, allowing the data to be viewed without %further processing.

%This project aimed to create a sensor suite capable of %remotely observing and mapping inaccessible areas and is %intended to be implemented into a pre-existing robotic %solution. The sensor suite combines real-time stereo camera %imagery with distance measurements and localization data to %generate a 3D depth map and 2D floorplan of its environment. %The system relies on a Xilinx Zynq SoC which offers unique %advantages in latency and power consumption compared to %standard computer-based solutions.

%This project created a proof of concept SLAM sensor suite capable of remotely observing and mapping inaccessible areas by combining real-time stereo camera imagery with distance measurements and localization data to generate both a 3D depth map and 2D floorplan of its environment. The system used a Xilinx Zynq SoC which offered unique advantages in latency and power consumption compared to standard computer-based solutions.


This project created a proof of concept SLAM sensor suite capable of remotely observing and mapping areas by combining real-time stereo camera imagery with distance measurements and localization data to generate a 3D depth map and 2D floorplan of its environment. The system used a Xilinx Zynq SoC consisting of an embedded processor and digital logic. The embedded processor was used to communicate with peripherals using Xilinx's built-in peripheral drivers, whereas the digital logic was used to parallelize data processing.

\subsection{IMU Data Processing}
The IMU's data processing was implemented in the Programmable Software because it involves complex mathematical equations, and can be easily integrated with the rangefinder's data in the Software Development Kit.

\subsubsection{Programmable Software}
Talk about the math, integration into the rangefinder's code, and how the IMU data rotates the rangefinder's data.

$^\dagger$ Note that we originally planned to purchase a Flir Lepton thermal camera module and accompanying breakout board to support two stereo OV7670 camera modules. After experimenting with the OV7670 camera module on our FPGA board, we realized that these camera modules are highly limited due to their low frame rate and poor documentation, and decided to search for a different camera module. In addition, at a price of \$223 for a thermal camera with an 80x60 degree resolution, 25 degree field of view, and 7-9Hz image sample rate, we believed that we were much better off spending our money on better camera modules that were more usable for our task.

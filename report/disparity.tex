\subsection{Disparity Algorithm}
After verifying that the camera interface was functional, a large portion of time was spent implementing a disparity algorithm that would allow for the extraction of 3D depth information from stereo image data. This algorithm was first implemented in \textsc{Matlab}, and was then transferred to programmable logic after the algorithm was verified working.

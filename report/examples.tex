\subsection{LaTeX Coding Examples}
This section isn't intended to remain here, but can serve as an example for how to set things up later on

\subsubsection{Figures} 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{WPI_Inst_Prim_FulClr.png}}
	\caption{A Test Figure}
	\label{wpiLogo}
\end{figure}

Using the \verb!\ref! command, I'm able to reference Figure \ref{wpiLogo} by calling \verb!\ref{wpiLogo}!.

\subsubsection{Code Snippet}
Code snippets can be created by calling \verb!\begin{lstlisting}!, inserting all code, and then calling \verb!\end{lstlisting}!. Also call \verb!\singlespacing! before the code snippet and \verb!\doublespacing! after to keep things from getting too big.
\singlespacing % single space code
\begin{lstlisting}
//verilog code example
always @ (x, y, z)
  x <= y + z;
\end{lstlisting}
\doublespacing % return to double spacing after

\subsubsection{Using the bibliography}
All bibliographic references are contained in \texttt{bib.tex}. To cite a reference in the paper, use the \verb!\cite! command.
\par
As an example, I can cite \textit{Serveball} at the end of this sentence by calling \verb!\cite{serveball}!.\cite{serveball}
\par
To cite multiple references, call \verb!\cite{ref1,ref2}!.\cite{serveball,porikli}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT clks/count[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP disp/laddr1 output disp/laddr1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-2) MREG Output pipelining - DSP addrb0 multiplier stage addrb0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPIP-1) Input pipelining - DSP camctl/lwrite1 input camctl/lwrite1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP addrb0 output addrb0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP disp/laddr1 output disp/laddr1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-2) MREG Output pipelining - DSP addrb0 multiplier stage addrb0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net clks/count_reg[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clks/count[1]_i_2/O, cell clks/count[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell disp/maxd_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT clks/count[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    deb/btn_val_reg {FDRE}
    deb/count_reg[0] {FDRE}
    deb/count_reg[1] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (ZPS7-1) PS7 block required - The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.

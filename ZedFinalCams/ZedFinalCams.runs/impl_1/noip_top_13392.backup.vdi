WARNING: [Route 35-468] The router encountered 7 pins that are both setup-critical and hold-critical and tried to fix hold violations at the expense of setup slack. Such pins are:
	disp/buffer_rows_reg[0]/CE

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.

# Simultaneous Personnel Localization and Mapping

This repository contains code and miscellaneous content for our [Major Qualifying Project](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/ece/mqp.html). 

We have chosen to create an FPGA-based real time mapping and personnel localization device for our project, and have an approximate project timeline of March-December 2016.

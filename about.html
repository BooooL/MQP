      <h1>About</h1>
<p>The overall goal of this project is to create a device capable of generating detailed maps
and imagery of an area in real-time. This device will rely on an FPGA, and will use image
processing algorithms capable of detecting, localizing, and tracking human beings. The
device will gather imagery from the visual light and infrared-spectrums, as well as localization
data and distance measurements from an IMU and a rangender. Along with gathering and
processing data, the device will also serve as a long-range wireless access point, and will be
able to transmit all generated maps and imagery in real-time. A major deliverable of this
project is that the transmitted data will be fully processed, allowing it to be viewed remotely
on less-powerful, mobile devices.</p>
      <p>
          This device will be especially useful for first responders. It is intended to be mounted on
a small remote control vehicle, allowing any connected user to wirelessly traverse dangerous
and remote locations in search of people in need. Since this device transmits data in real-
time, it will be able to provide first responders with an accurate representation of not only
a 2-D 
oor plan of an area such as a building, but also where any people are located. An
anticipated use of this device would be in the event of a building in danger of collapsing.
Since it would be dangerous to physically enter the building, first responders could locate
any people trapped inside and find the fastest route to them using the wirelessly transmitted
oorplan. The first responders would also be aware of any dangers in their way by making
use of the real-time augmented video stream. This video stream will consist of image data
with overlaid with object indicators and location information on any human beings detected
by the image processing algorithms.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net clk_50mS is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp CLK_24MHz/dcm_sp_inst,
   consult the device Data Sheet.
DRC detected 0 errors and 1 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
